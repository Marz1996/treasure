This is an ECO RTL_vs_gate verification.  There is no SVF file.

The customer changed both the RTL and the gate-level netlist manually without re-running synthesis.
The new RTL is golden.  However, the netlist can be modified.

A new engineer is trying to verify the design and is having problems.  You need to help him modify 
the gate-level netlist to correctly implement the ECO.

See "./.hint/README" if you need help.
